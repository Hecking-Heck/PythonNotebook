# Labelled vs. Unlabelled Data
Unlabeled data mainly consists of the samples of natural or human-created objects that can easily be obtained
from the world. They include, audio, video, photos, news articles, etc.

On the other hand, labeled data take a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of that unlabeled data
with some tag or label or class that is meaningful. For example, if we have a photo then the label can be put
based on the content of the photo, i.e., a photo of a boy or a girl or an animal. Labeling the data needs human
expertise or judgement about a given piece of unlabeled data.

There are many scenarios where unlabeled data is plentiful and easily obtained but labeled data often requires a
human/expert to annotate. Semi-supervised learning attempts to combine labeled and unlabeled data to build
better models.
