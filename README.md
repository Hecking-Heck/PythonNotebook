# Getting an IDE
Any of the following will do but I prefer Visual Studio Code.

[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

[Atom](https://atom-editor.cc)


# Quickstart Guide
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> [!NOTE]
> - I am using Python 3.12.1

- Install an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
 
- Download the .zip file of this Repository and open it up in Visual Studio code.
 
- From the start you should be able to go to Terminal > New Terminal and then run
  ```py
  py index.py
  ```
> [!NOTE]
> - You may need to CD into the Basics directory first.
> ```bash
> cd Basics
> ```

If the file successfully runs, you are all set!
